# Contributing to UMS Bot Core

UMS Bot Core is a minimal, stable foundation for Discord tournaments.

If you'd like to contribute:

- Open an Issue first for bugs or feature proposals
- Try to keep changes focused and small
- Follow the existing style (black, ruff, mypy, pytest)

Premium/advanced features (Solo Queue, Elo, clans, etc.) are planned as separate closed-source or hosted components. Please keep contributions focused on stability, clarity, and usability of Core.
